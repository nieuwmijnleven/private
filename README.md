JADEx (Java Advanced Development Extension) is **a practical solution for Java null-safety**. It lets you enhance your code’s safety and **without rewriting it**, while **fully leveraging existing Java libraries and tools**.

---

## ✨ Project Overview

### Key Idea

* JADEx **strengthens Java’s null-related type system in a way similar to how TypeScript enhances JavaScript’s type system**. It brings compile-time null-safety to your existing Java code without requiring a complete rewrite.

          +---------------------------+
          |       Existing Java       |
          | (potentially null-prone)  |
          +------------+--------------+
                       |
                       v
       +-----------------------------------+
       |           JADEx Tools             |
       | (strengthens type system          |
       |  & applies null-safety operators) |
       +----------------+------------------+
                        |
                        v
          +---------------------------+
          |   Null-Safe Java Code     |
          | (enhanced compile-time    |
          |  null-safety guarantees)  |
          +---------------------------+

Analogy: Java + JADEx  ≅  JavaScript + TypeScript

### Key Benefits

* Familiar Syntax: **No new language to learn, just safer Java.**
* Seamless Integration: Works with existing Java projects with minimal changes.
* Incremental Adoption: Apply null-safety only where you need it.
* Enhanced Code Safety: Catch potential null-pointer issues at compile time, not runtime.

## 💡 How to make your java code null-safe

Making your existing Java code null-safe with JADEx is simple and straightforward. The process guides you from analyzing potential null-pointer issues to applying null-safety operators, and finally generating safe, standard Java code without rewriting your code or leaving the Java ecosystem.

### Workflow (with JADEx IntelliJ Plugin)

The typical JADEx workflow for producing Java source code with enhanced null-safety guarantees is as follows: 

```
           << JAVA SOURCE >>
                   ↓
     << COPIED AS-IS TO .JADEX >>
                   ↓
           << JADEX SOURCE >>
                   ↓
     << JADEX NULL-SAFETY ANALYSIS >>
                   ↓
         << REVIEW THE RESULTS >>
                   ↓
   << APPLY JADEX NULL-SAFETY OPERATORS >>
                   ↓
           << JADEX COMPILER >>
                   ↓
   << JAVA SOURCE WITH ENHANCED NULL-SAFETY >>

```

* Existing Java source files are copied unchanged into `.jadex` files. JADEx null-safety operators are then applied to the JADEx sources to explicitly annotate and enforce null-safety semantics. These annotated JADEx sources are subsequently compiled by the JADEx compiler into Java source code with enhanced null-safety guarantees.
 
* Essentially, **all you need to do is review the null-safety analysis results and apply the null-safety operators** in your `.jadex` files. The JADEx IntelliJ plugin takes care of the rest automatically.
### JADEx IntelliJ Plugin Installation

### 📚 Essential Examples
- Simple, focused examples showing how to use JADEx null-safety operators.

#### ✅ Example ① - Compile-time null assignment check

JADEx explicitly defines nullability at the type system level and performs **compile-time checks**  
to eliminate the possibility of `NullPointerException` at runtime.

#### 📌 Basic Rules

- `Type` → **non-nullable** (cannot be assigned `null`)
- `Type?` → **nullable** (can be assigned `null`)
- `?.` → safely access methods or fields on nullable objects
- `?:` → elvis operator: returns the left-hand side if non-null, otherwise the right-hand side (x ?: y ≡ (x != null) ? x : y) 

#### 📄 Example – `NullableType1.jadex`

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String? s1 = null;
        String s2 = null;
    }
}
```

- `s1` is a **nullable** variable and can be assigned `null`.
- `s2` is a **non-nullable** variable, so assigning `null` causes a **compile-time error**.

#### ❌ Output

```
Warning: (line:6, column:8) s2 is a non-nullable variable. But null value is assigned to it.
```
---

### ✅ Example ② — Enforcing the null-safe operator (`?.`)

In JADEx, **you must use the `?.` operator when accessing nullable variables.**  
If you try to access fields or methods on a potentially-null object without the null-safe operator, a compile-time error will occur.


#### 📄 Example – `NullableType2.jadex`

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String? s1 = null;
        String s2 = "JADEx";

        s1.length();
        s2.length();
    }
}
```

- `s1` is **nullable** but tries to call a method **without using the null-safe operator (`?.`)**  
  → **Compile-time error**

- `s2` is **non-nullable**, so method access is allowed without issue


#### ❌ Output

```
Warning: (line:8, column:8) s1 is a nullable variable. But it direct accesses to length(). You must consider to use null-safe operator(?.)
```

#### ✅ Corrected Code (Works as Expected)

```java
s1?.length(); // null-safe access
s2.length();  // regular access
```

As shown above, JADEx **enforces safe access to nullable variables at the language level**,  
helping to eliminate null-related runtime errors before they happen.

---
### ✅ Example ③ — Elvis Operator (`?:`)

JADEx introduces the **Elvis operator (`?:`)**,  
which allows you to easily provide a default or fallback value when a nullable variable is `null`.

#### 📄 Example – `ElvisOperator.jadex`

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String? s1 = null;
        String s2 = s1 ?: "JADEx";
        System.out.printf("s1 = %s\n", s1 ?: "null-value");
        System.out.printf("s2 = %s\n", s2);
    }
}
```

- `s1` is a nullable variable.
- `s1 ?: "JADEx"` assigns `"JADEx"` if `s1` is `null`.
- When printing, `s1 ?: "null-value"` safely handles null values.
  
#### ✅ Output (Java code generated by JADEx)

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        @org.jspecify.annotations.Nullable String s1 = null;
        String s2 = java.util.Optional.ofNullable(s1).orElseGet(() -> "JADEx");
        System.out.printf("s1 = %s\n", java.util.Optional.ofNullable(s1).orElseGet(() -> "null-value"));
        System.out.printf("s2 = %s\n", s2);
    }
}
```

---
### ✅ Example ④ — Correct Usage of the Null-safe Operator (`?.`)

In JADEx, the use of the **null-safe access operator (`?.`) is enforced** for nullable variables.  
This prevents null reference errors and allows safe method calls on potentially null values.

#### 📄 Example – `NullsafeOperator.jadex`

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String? s1 = null;
        String s2 = "JADEx";
        System.out.printf("the length of s1 : %d\n", s1?.length());
        System.out.printf("the length of s2 : %d\n", s2.length());
    }
}
```

- `s1` is a nullable variable.
- `s1?.length()` safely returns `null` if `s1` is `null`.
- `s2` is non-nullable, so calling `length()` is valid without safety checks.

#### ✅ Output (Java code generated by JADEx)

```java
package jadex.example;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        @org.jspecify.annotations.Nullable String s1 = null;
        String s2 = "JADEx";
        System.out.printf("the length of s1 : %d\n", java.util.Optional.ofNullable(s1).map(t0 -> t0.length()).orElse(null));
        System.out.printf("the length of s2 : %d\n", s2.length());
    }
}
```

This example demonstrates how JADEX handles the null-safe operator for nullable variables  
and clearly shows how to write code that adheres to JADEx's null safety rules.

---
### ✅ Example ⑤ — Combining `?.` and `?:` Operators

JADEx supports **combining the null-safe access operator (`?.`) and the Elvis operator (`?:`)**  
to simplify complex null-handling logic into clean and concise expressions.

#### 📄 Example – `NullsafeWithElvisOperator.jadex`

```java
package jadex.example;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String? s1 = null;
        String s2 = s1 ?: "JADEx";
        System.out.printf("the length of s1 : %d\n", s1?.length() ?: 0);
        System.out.printf("the length of s2 : %d\n", s2.length());
    }
}
```

- `s1` is a nullable variable.
- `s1 ?: "JADEx"` → assigns `"JADEx"` if `s1` is null.
- `s1?.length() ?: 0` → safely calls `length()` on `s1`, returns `0` if `s1` is null.
- By combining both operators, **null handling becomes safe and concise**.

#### ✅ Output (Java code generated by JADEx)

```java
package jadex.example;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        @org.jspecify.annotations.Nullable String s1 = null;
        String s2 = java.util.Optional.ofNullable(s1).orElseGet(() -> "JADEx");
        System.out.printf("the length of s1 : %d\n", java.util.Optional.ofNullable(s1).map(t0 -> t0.length()).orElseGet(() -> 0));
        System.out.printf("the length of s2 : %d\n", s2.length());
    }
}
```

> The expression `s1?.length() ?: 0` is translated into a nested conditional check in Java:  
> `java.util.Optional.ofNullable(s1).map(t0 -> t0.length()).orElseGet(() -> 0)`, ensuring safe execution.

JADEx is a fully Java-compatible superset that brings compile-time null safety to your existing Java code — without rewriting it, without changing the JVM, and without leaving the familiar Java syntax behind.
        
With JADEx, development teams can gradually adopt null-safety at the type level, improving code reliability and reducing runtime null-pointer exceptions, just like TypeScript did for JavaScript.

        Key Benefits:
        - Seamless Integration: Works with existing Java projects with minimal changes.
        - Incremental Adoption: Apply null-safety only where you need it.
        - Enhanced Code Safety: Catch potential null-pointer issues at compile time, not runtime.
        - Familiar Syntax: No new language to learn, just safer Java.

        JADEx makes your Java code safer, more maintainable, and future-proof — without compromise.
 



JPlus is fully compatible with Java, offering modern language features like null safety, boilerplate code generation and other modern language features to reduce developer burden and maximize productivity.

Notably, **there is currently no ‘superset’ language that keeps Java syntax almost intact while extending the language with features like null checks at the language level.** JPlus aims to fill this gap, providing a language that existing **Java developers can naturally learn and adopt**.

### Why JPlus?

- **Maintains Java Compatibility**  
  Fully utilizes existing Java libraries and frameworks

- **Enhances Development Productivity**  
  Automates null checks, supports boilerplate code generating syntax and other modern features

---

### 🔍 Overview
| JPlus `apply` Syntax                     | Equivalent Lombok Annotation          |
|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `data`                                   | `@Data`                              |
| `getter`                                 | `@Getter`                            |
| `setter`                                 | `@Setter`                            |
| `equals`, `hashCode` or combined `equality` | `@EqualsAndHashCode`              |
| `toString`                               | `@ToString`                          |
| `constructors(no)`                       | `@NoArgsConstructor`                 |
| `constructors(all)`                      | `@AllArgsConstructor`                |
| `constructors(required)`                 | `@RequiredArgsConstructor`           |
| `builder`                                | `@Builder`                           |
| `value` or `immutable`                   | `@Value`                             | |
| `logger(slf4j)` / `logger(java)`         | `@Slf4j` / `@Log`                    |

> Additional method-level and delegation features are also supported.

cd JPlus
```

---

### 3. Build the Project

Use the Gradle wrapper to build the compiler and run examples:
```bash
./gradlew app:build
```

---

### 4. Running Examples

To run a specific example file (e.g., NullableType1.jplus), use:
```bash
./gradlew run -Pargs="./src/test/samples/NullableType1.jplus"
```

Replace the argument path with any example you want to execute.

---
### ✅ Example ① - Compile-time null assignment check

JPlus explicitly defines nullability at the type system level and performs **compile-time checks**  
to eliminate the possibility of `NullPointerException` at runtime.

---

#### 📌 Basic Rules

- `Type` → **non-nullable** (cannot be assigned `null`)
- `Type?` → **nullable** (can be assigned `null`)
- `?.` → safely access methods or fields on nullable objects

---

#### 📄 Example – `NullableType1.jplus`

```java
package jadex.example;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String? s1 = null;
        String s2 = null;
    }
}
```

- `s1` is a **nullable** variable and can be assigned `null`.
- `s2` is a **non-nullable** variable, so assigning `null` causes a **compile-time error**.

---

#### ▶️ Run Command

```bash
./gradlew run -Pargs="./src/test/samples/NullableType1.jplus"
```

---

#### ❌ Output

```
Warning: (line:6, column:8) s2 is a non-nullable variable. But null value is assigned to it.
```

---

By enforcing **explicit type declarations** and **compile-time null checks**,  
JPlus helps prevent null-related bugs early in the development process.

This approach is similar to **strict null checking** found in languages like Kotlin and TypeScript,  
but with the key benefit of being **gradually adoptable while preserving Java syntax**.

---
### ✅ Example ② — Enforcing the null-safe operator (`?.`)

In JPlus, **you must use the `?.` operator when accessing nullable variables.**  
If you try to access fields or methods on a potentially-null object without the null-safe operator, a compile-time error will occur.

---

#### 📄 Example – `NullableType2.jplus`

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String? s1 = null;
        String s2 = "jplus";

        s1.length();
        s2.length();
    }
}
```

- `s1` is **nullable** but tries to call a method **without using the null-safe operator (`?.`)**  
  → **Compile-time error**

- `s2` is **non-nullable**, so method access is allowed without issue

---

#### ▶️ Run Command

```bash
./gradlew run -Pargs="./src/test/samples/NullableType2.jplus"
```

---

#### ❌ Output

```
Warning: (line:8, column:8) s1 is a nullable variable. But it direct accesses to length(). You must consider to use null-safe operator(?.)
```

---

#### ✅ Corrected Code (Works as Expected)

```java
s1?.length(); // null-safe access
s2.length();  // regular access
```

---

As shown above, JPlus **enforces safe access to nullable variables at the language level**,  
helping to eliminate null-related runtime errors before they happen.

---
### ✅ Example ③ — Elvis Operator (`?:`)

JPlus introduces the **Elvis operator (`?:`)**,  
which allows you to easily provide a default or fallback value when a nullable variable is `null`.

---

#### 📄 Example – `ElvisOperator.jplus`

```java
package jadex.example;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String? s1 = null;
        String s2 = s1 ?: "jplus";
        System.out.printf("s1 = %s\n", s1 ?: "null-value");
        System.out.printf("s2 = %s\n", s2);
    }
}
```

- `s1` is a nullable variable.
- `s1 ?: "jplus"` assigns `"jplus"` if `s1` is `null`.
- When printing, `s1 ?: "null-value"` safely handles null values.

---

#### ▶️ Run Command

```bash
./gradlew run -Pargs="./src/test/samples/ElvisOperator.jplus"
```

---

#### ✅ Output (Java code generated by JPlus)

```java
package jadex.example;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        @org.jspecify.annotations.Nullable String s1 = null;
        String s2 = java.util.Optional.ofNullable(s1).orElseGet(() -> "jplus");
        System.out.printf("s1 = %s\n", java.util.Optional.ofNullable(s1).orElseGet(() -> "null-value"));
        System.out.printf("s2 = %s\n", s2);
    }
}
```

> The Elvis operator expression `x ?: y` is translated to Java's ternary expression `(x != null) ? x : y`.

### ✅ Example ④ — Correct Usage of the Null-safe Operator (`?.`)

In JPlus, the use of the **null-safe access operator (`?.`) is enforced** for nullable variables.  
This prevents null reference errors and allows safe method calls on potentially null values.

---

#### 📄 Example – `NullsafeOperator.jplus`

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String? s1 = null;
        String s2 = "jplus";
        System.out.printf("the length of s1 : %d\n", s1?.length());
        System.out.printf("the length of s2 : %d\n", s2.length());
    }
}
```

- `s1` is a nullable variable.
- `s1?.length()` safely returns `null` if `s1` is `null`.
- `s2` is non-nullable, so calling `length()` is valid without safety checks.

---

#### ▶️ Run Command

```bash
./gradlew run -Pargs="./src/test/samples/NullsafeOperator.jplus"
```

---

#### ✅ Output (Java code generated by JPlus)

```java
package jadex.example;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        @org.jspecify.annotations.Nullable String s1 = null;
        String s2 = "jplus";
        System.out.printf("the length of s1 : %d\n", java.util.Optional.ofNullable(s1).map(t0 -> t0.length()).orElse(null));
        System.out.printf("the length of s2 : %d\n", s2.length());
    }
}
```

---

This example demonstrates how JPlus handles the null-safe operator for nullable variables  
and clearly shows how to write code that adheres to JPlus's null safety rules.

---
### ✅ Example ⑤ — Combining `?.` and `?:` Operators

JPlus supports **combining the null-safe access operator (`?.`) and the Elvis operator (`?:`)**  
to simplify complex null-handling logic into clean and concise expressions.

---

#### 📄 Example – `NullsafeWithElvisOperator.jplus`

```java
package jadex.example;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String? s1 = null;
        String s2 = s1 ?: "jplus";
        System.out.printf("the length of s1 : %d\n", s1?.length() ?: 0);
        System.out.printf("the length of s2 : %d\n", s2.length());
    }
}
```

- `s1` is a nullable variable.
- `s1 ?: "jplus"` → assigns `"jplus"` if `s1` is null.
- `s1?.length() ?: 0` → safely calls `length()` on `s1`, returns `0` if `s1` is null.
- By combining both operators, **null handling becomes safe and concise**.

---

#### ▶️ Run Command

```bash
./gradlew run -Pargs="./src/test/samples/NullsafeWithElvisOperator.jplus"
```

---

#### ✅ Output (Java code generated by JPlus)

```java
package jadex.example;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        @org.jspecify.annotations.Nullable String s1 = null;
        String s2 = java.util.Optional.ofNullable(s1).orElseGet(() -> "jplus");
        System.out.printf("the length of s1 : %d\n", java.util.Optional.ofNullable(s1).map(t0 -> t0.length()).orElseGet(() -> 0));
        System.out.printf("the length of s2 : %d\n", s2.length());
    }
}
```

> The expression `s1?.length() ?: 0` is translated into a nested conditional check in Java:  
> `java.util.Optional.ofNullable(s1).map(t0 -> t0.length()).orElseGet(() -> 0)`, ensuring safe execution.

### ✅ Example ⑥ — Using apply for Data Class and Nested Class Boilerplate Elimination

JPlus introduces the apply keyword to replace common Java boilerplate code such as getters, setters, constructors, builders, and more.
It serves as a language-level alternative to Lombok annotations, offering a clean and declarative syntax.

---

#### 📄 Example – `ApplyStatement.jplus`

```java
package com.example;

apply data, constructor(required, all, no), builder;
apply {
    User.Profile: getter, setter, equality, constructor(all);
}

public class User {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    public class Profile {
        String nickname;
    }
}
```
- `data`:	Automatically generates getters, setters, equals(), hashCode(), and toString()
- `builder`: Generates a User.Builder class for fluent object creation
- `constructors(required, all, no)`:Generates a constructor with all/required fields and a no-argument constructor
- `equality`: Generates equals() and hashCode() methods
- `apply { User.Profile: ... }`: Applies boilerplate generation specifically to the Profile inner class
---

#### ▶️ Run Command

```bash
./gradlew run -Pargs="./src/test/samples/ApplyStatement.jplus"
```

#### ✅ Output (Java code generated by JPlus)

```java
package com.example;

//apply data, constructor(required, all, no), builder;
//apply {
//    User.Profile: getter, setter, equality, constructor(all);
//}

public class User {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    public User(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    public User() {}

    public class Profile {
        String nickname;

        public Profile(String nickname) {
            this.nickname = nickname;
        }

        public String getNickname() {
            return nickname;
        }

        public void setNickname(String nickname) {
            this.nickname = nickname;
        }

        @Override
        public boolean equals(Object o) {
            if (this == o) return true;
            if (o == null || getClass() != o.getClass()) return false;
            Profile profile = (Profile) o;
            return java.util.Objects.equals(nickname, profile.nickname);
        }

        @Override
        public int hashCode() {
            return java.util.Objects.hash(nickname);
        }
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public int getAge() {
        return age;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public void setAge(int age) {
        this.age = age;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "User{" + "name=" + name+ ", " + "age=" + age + "}";
    }

    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object o) {
        if (this == o) return true;
        if (o == null || getClass() != o.getClass()) return false;
        User user = (User) o;
        return age == user.age
                && java.util.Objects.equals(name, user.name);
    }

    @Override
    public int hashCode() {
        return java.util.Objects.hash(name, age);
    }

    public static class Builder {
        private String name;
        private int age;

        public Builder name(String name) {
            this.name = name;
            return this;
        }

        public Builder age(int age) {
            this.age = age;
            return this;
        }

        public User build() {
            return new User(name, age);
        }
    }

    public static Builder builder() {
        return new Builder();
    }
}
```

#### 🎯 Benefits of This Approach

- ✅ Eliminates the need for manual method and constructor generation
- ✅ Clean, declarative syntax – no annotations or external dependencies
- ✅ Fine-grained control over nested types (e.g. inner classes)
- ✅ All features translate into standard Java code at compile time
---
#### 📘 Tip: Use apply {} block for Nested Classes

The apply block allows you to target specific nested or inner classes with scoped boilerplate logic:
```java
apply {
    Outer.Inner: getter, setter;
}
```

This allows developers to keep code DRY and expressive even with deeply nested structures.

---

### 📌 Summary

This example demonstrates a **natural combination** of the following features:

- ✅ **Null-safe method call** (`s1?.length()`)  
  Ensures safe access to nullable variables without throwing `NullPointerException`.

- ✅ **Default fallback value** (`?: 0`)  
  Provides a default value when an expression evaluates to `null`, improving code safety and readability.

- ✅ **Declarative boilerplate generation with `apply`**  
  The `apply` statement allows you to automatically generate common methods like `getters`, `setters`, `equals()`, `hashCode()`, `toString()`, and constructors without relying on annotations or third-party libraries like Lombok.

JPlus allows even complex null-handling logic to be expressed **safely and concisely** with its extended syntax.
